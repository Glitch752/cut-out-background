## cut-out-background

I've sometimes needed a way to remove the background from a video, but I want to be able to manually control what gets removed. That's what this program allows you to do.  
Currently, it's very manual and tedious, but I'm planning some features to make it less so.

### Todo
- Detect where the selected area in the frame moves to and move the selection for less manual work  
- Allow addition of points midway through a line  
- Add ability to set image as background
